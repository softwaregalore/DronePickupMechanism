# DronePickupMechanism
This repository contains the code and documentation of my 2023-2024 TSA Drone competition. clampControl.ino contains the C++ code that was installed on the ESP8266 mentioned in the documentation, and index.h/testApplication.html contain the GUI code. The code essentially sets up a small Access Point on our ESP and uses a websocket connection to send information from the users device back to the drone.
